// // #Assignment 01 - A ReST API & Postman testing
// // Once upon a time, there was a company named Hicoders. Hicoders had many talented employees working in different departments such as software development, marketing, and customer service.
//  The company was growing quickly and needed a way to keep track of their employee information. They decided to create an employee management system using a web application.
// // The software development team was tasked with building the backend of the web application. They created several endpoints for the frontend team to use, including one that 
// returns a list of all employees, one that adds a new employee to the system with a unique short-uuid identifier, and several others that retrieve information about the employees
//  such as the highest and lowest salary, and employees from specific countries.
// // The frontend team used these endpoints to create a user-friendly interface for the company's HR department. The HR team was able to easily add new employees to the system, 
// view their information, and retrieve data such as the highest and lowest salary, and employees from specific countries.
// // Thanks to the hard work of the software development team, Hicoders was able to efficiently manage their employees' information and continue to grow their business.

// //  Criteria
// // For each endpoint, the HTTP method and endpoint URL should be provided.Use the short-uuid library to generate a unique id for each user added with the POST operation.
// Use the GET/   create home page endpointUse the GET /users endpoint to retrieve the list of all users.Use the POST /users endpoint to add a new user. All information about the added
// user (name, surname, country, and salary) should be sent as a JSON data structure.Use the GET /users/highest-salary endpoint to retrieve the information of the user with the highest salary.
// Use the GET /users/lowest-salary endpoint to retrieve the information of the user with the lowest salary.
// // Use the GET/users/country=Switzerland  endpoint to retrieve the list of Swiss users.

// // Example List :
// // users =

// // {"id": "2", "name":"Emma","surname":"Wilson","country":"UK","salary":5500},
